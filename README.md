## Description:

Third person shooter game powered by UE 4, made with UE 4.22.

Personal project made by https://github.com/jsngn (dev) and https://github.com/sethks21 (designer).

## Gameplay:

You are a bacon living in a New York apartment that is being abandoned soon. You must find your way out before you are left to be eaten by the pests!
Make your way out of the apartment, down the stairs, and into the kitchen of a restaurant that operates below the apartment. There you will find 
the 'Golden Oven' that has everything a bacon could ever want: warmth and GREASE! Use your grease gun, which uses your own grease/health as ammo, to temporarily 
distract the pests or damage them. You cannot damage humans with your grease and they can step on you, so steer clear! Lastly, you only have five bullets per level, 
so use it wisely!
